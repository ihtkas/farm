####Farm is an application to efficiently move commodities from seller to buyer. 

The application tries to connect three important requirements.

1. Buyer wants to buy a quality product directly from seller and reduce expenses incured from middle men and dealers.
2. Sellers wants to sell their product direclty to buyers offcourse to maximise the profit.
3. Travellers wants to reduce the expenses on the transport.

Farm provides a platform to achieve this. Sellers can post ads for their product and buyers can  request to buy them. Travellers can pick up and deliver the product for a nominal cost compared to expenses for dealers. Farm app matches these requests efficiently and makes everyone lives easier.


####Why Am I writing this?
   To get hands on experience on various backend techs like Microservice architectur, Kafka streams, RDBMS(postrgres), NoSQL(cassandra), gRPC, protobuf, REST APIs. I have used some of these in professional career and read about some from online resources. I decided to use all of them and understand these with first hand experience in this project.


###TODO:
- REST APIs implementation
- Design matching algorithm
- Async processing using Kafka streams
- Use open source IAM
